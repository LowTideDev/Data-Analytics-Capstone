# Environment Setup

This repository has no code or requirements yet. Below is a sample setup script to create a Python virtual environment, install common dataâ€‘analysis packages, and load the dataset pieces without generating large files.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab

python - <<'PY'
import pandas as pd, glob, json

csv_files = sorted(glob.glob('data/raw/games_part_*.csv'))
if csv_files:
    df = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(f) for f in csv_files), ignore_index=True)
    # `df` now holds the combined records in memory

json_files = sorted(glob.glob('data/raw/games_json_part_*.json'))
merged = {}
for fp in json_files:
    with open(fp) as f:
        merged.update(json.load(f))
# `merged` contains all JSON records in memory

This script mirrors the original assistant response and can be adjusted as needed.
