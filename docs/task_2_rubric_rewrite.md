## Purpose
To rewrite your Task 2 Capstone report so that it meets **every rubric requirement** and passes on next submission, while preserving your original insights and strong analysis.

This version will:
- **Match the GitHub-based WGU template** used by mentors
- **Use explicit section headers and sentence stems**
- **Restate your reasoning** in the style they expect (even when it’s already obvious)
- Avoid over-explaining, but make sure **every box is visibly checked**

## High-Level Flow (What They Want)

### A. Introduction & Framing
- A1: Clear research question (1 sentence)
- A2: Background & context for why this matters (digital storefronts, indie devs)
- A3: Summarize 3 sources
- A3a: Explain how each relates to the question
- A4: What you’re delivering (models, visuals)
- A5: How this helps someone make decisions

### B. Project Plan
- B1: Goals, objectives, deliverables — explicitly and aligned
- B2: Scope: What’s in / what’s out
- B3: Methodology (regression, clustering, Python stack)
- B4: Timeline and milestone estimates
- B5: Tools and costs (including free tools)
- B6: Criteria for success: "I’ll know this succeeded when..."

### C. Analysis Design
- C1: Hypothesis (state it cleanly)
- C2: Methods chosen
- C2a: Why those methods
- C3: Tools/environments used (Python, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, etc.)
- C4: Metrics to evaluate output
- C4a: Why those metrics
- C5: Practical value: "How will someone use this?"
- C6: Visuals used and how they communicate findings

### D. Data Description
- D1: Where data came from
- D2: Why it’s appropriate
- D3: How it was collected
- D4: Completeness and quality
- D5: Governance/ethics/privacy
- D5a: Precautions taken

We'll go section by section next. But now that we’ve defined this blueprint, we won’t lose sight of the end goal as we rewrite.

Let me know when you’re ready to start with A1 and we’ll build the new doc inside this structure.
